The purpose of this repository is to provide the methodology and analysis for optimizing the flow rate of a piping water loop consisting of approximately 100 feet of 2" SCH. 40 pipe with 10 elbows, 6 gate valves, and two heat exchangers(finned tube cross flow with air mixed, water unmixed) in series.

Optimizing energy systems with computation simulations is critical to ensuring a system makes the most effective use of equipment life and energy. This water loop simulation was modeled in python.
The water loop system modelled is illustrated below.
